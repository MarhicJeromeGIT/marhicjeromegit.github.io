<p>Yesterday we got the announcement that <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket">Pocket was saying goodbye</a>. Kind of bummed because I found the service convenient, though I just used it as a link bookmark (I never cared much about the reading mode, I always go to the original link - though apparently that worked well with the Kobo e-reader).

<p>Anyway, I was importing my old pocket saves into my new Wallabag setup (I&rsquo;ve got a script to import your links from Pocket <a href="https://gist.github.com/MarhicJeromeGIT/6a87d8f8744b49c7e32315180729ae9b">here</a>) and I found an old save from Russ Cox&rsquo;s blog, <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast </a>.
