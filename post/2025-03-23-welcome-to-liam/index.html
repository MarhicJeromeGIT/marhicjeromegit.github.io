Apparently it got forked into Gymnasium and it is still maintained.\nI was wondering how ChatGPT would perform on it so I made a small script that takes screenshots (every N frames) and prompts ChatGPT for actions in the Lunar Lander minigame. The goal is to land the lander softly and straight… It’s not going too well either for me so far! At the time of OpenAI Gym, the main approach was to give unlabelled data to the model and let it figure out what the input and output mean through countless observation steps, figuring out a winning strategy just via the reward.
