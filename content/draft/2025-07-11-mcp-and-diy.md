My company seems to love Jira's "custom fields", with an inconvenient side effect that I can't copy and paste a ticket content (since it is split into multiple fields, and by multiple I mean a lot). Inconvenience compounded by the fact they don't bother translating the tickets into English anymore. All that to say I was on the market for a JIRA mcp, but somehow I do not feel comfortable using the code from "somedude89/jira-mcp" github repository.
