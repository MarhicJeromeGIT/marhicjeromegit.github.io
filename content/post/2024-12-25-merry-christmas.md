title: Merry Christmas!

I took a day off on this Christmas day, and I got inspired to revive this blog by reading Simon Willison's ["approach to running a link blog"](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/). I like his blog to keep updated about the new models' capabilities and developments in the AI world in general. He makes small experiments to put the models into practice, with a good dose of enthusiasm, and I want to follow a similar approach for this blog: sharing interesting articles I read, and some of my daily programming experiments, while ["trying to add something extra"](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/#trying-to-add-something-extra).

It's one of my pet peeves at work; some colleagues will regularly share on Slack some article link, without any commentary on why they found it interesting or why it may be relevant or useful to our company. Just that random link (usually something that was already posted several days ago on HackerNews). That usually never triggers any discussion, at best a few thumbs-up emojis üëç. Not sure what their goal is, I assume it's only to pretend they stay up to date technically. Thanks for nothing, I guess.

Anyway, back to my blog. One first step I'm taking is to "Disable Completions for 'Markdown'" in my code editor. I love it for code (more on that later), but even though I'm not a good writer, I want those words to be mine.

Originally I thought I would use this blog to "market myself" and my potential commercial projects, but I don't actually have any at the moment, and it puts too much pressure on being "perfect" and I ended up sounding fake and not myself. My new reduced ambitions are just to post regular, imperfect blog posts (I might come back and edit them later on) about what I found interesting lately.
