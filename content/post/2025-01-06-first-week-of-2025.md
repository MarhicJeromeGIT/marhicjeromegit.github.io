### 2025 is off to a pretty good start!

I spent 3 days alone in Phu Quoc to recharge, didn’t do anything except swimming and [reading Thistlefoot](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60018639-thistlefoot) while drinking coconuts. I used to go regularly when I was single, but now it's going to be my last trip for a while. Got lucky with the weather as well!

Back home, I’ve made some progress on my crossword solver app. I opened a WebSocket to stream the intermediary results ("dead ends") as the backtracking algorithm progresses; I think it looks cool. In the frontend, I’ve added a history so you can Ctrl-Z, and other minor convenience changes (right-click to toggle between black and white cells, etc). I should define the scope, though; I don’t plan to make it a full-blown "crossword editor." I think I will just add the ability to export a grid and be done with it.

I hope to share it on Hacker News sometime this year. Reactions can be pretty harsh sometimes, but let’s see how this one goes.

Speaking of Hacker News, there was a funny blog post shared recently, ["I am rich and have no idea what to do with my life"](https://vinay.sh/i-am-rich-and-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life/). The 1500+ reactions it generated were as expected (a mix of contempt and jealousy). Got some good links, though, especially this blog about ["early retirement"](https://philip.greenspun.com/materialism/early-retirement/). I’m generally happy, and I’ve got kids to take care of, so I feel like I’m in a good position to enjoy myself during early retirement—I just need to find the money!
