title: January 2025, Second Week Update
---

Already two weeks into January, it's time for an update on my projects! I'm really happy with the progress on [Prosettr.com](https://prosettr.com), my crossword generation app. It will soon be time to share it with the world (HackerNews...). Yesterday evening, I added login functionality (a choice of email + password or Google sign-in) using Firebase Authentication, as well as a button to load PUZ files.

The latter was surprisingly easy to do: I gave ChatGPT o1-mini the [PUZ format description](https://gist.github.com/sliminality/dab21fa834eae0a70193c7cd69c356d5) and asked it for a loader/writer in Go with my expectations for the input/output, followed by an HTTP handler. Thirty minutes later, here we are with the "Upload PUZ File" in production!

It seems like for every feature I add, I get an idea for another one, so I started prioritizing and separating "must-have" and "nice-to-have" features. "Nice-to-have" features include everything related to "word scores" (the "quality" of a word) and prioritizing high-quality words in the search. It's important, but getting users first seems more important. The same goes for multithreadingâ€”I wish the search was faster, but for now, there is no one waiting for the results, so...

"Must-have" features, however, include finding a better word list, an export button, authenticating the backend endpoints, implementing per-user search quotas (easy now that users are logged in), writing an "About" page, etc. There's so much left to do!

I'm taking a week off at the end of the month for Lunar New Year. I'll try to push and finish the app by then.
