What a year it has been ! I got my second kid early this year and was plenty busy child rearing as my number one priority, but I somehow managed to put some stuff out, let's get through it.

2025 retrospective

## The good

### Blogging

28 posts in 2025. I managed to keep the blog alive, with around 2 new posts per month. I enjoy the process, it's a nice outlet for venting and also sharing my projects. It even sometime forced me to work on something new just to have something to write about !

### Personal projects

I've released 4 projects : [Prosettr.com](https://prosettr.com/) - a crossword generation app, [Goxy](https://github.com/goverture/goxy) a budget limiter proxy for Openai API, [Gopilotty](https://github.com/goverture/gopilotty) a TTY enabled copilot, and [Podpocket](https://podpocket.jmarhic.com) - a podcast player. I do actually use Podpocket daily, as it fits exactly my needs ! Also, everything was written in Go, still enjoying the language a lot !

Notably I based Podpocket out of [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) and it was such an enjoyable development experience, I can't wait to start a new project with it again soon.

I've also worked on minor stuff in between: [The password game agent]({{< ref "2025-06-18-the-password-game-agent" >}}) - an agent that plays [Neal.fun's password game](https://neal.fun/password-game/), [Pillmish](2025-08-09-pillmish.md) - training a small LLM from scratch, etc. So given the time limitation, I'm happy with this year output.

### Tech stuff

In November I switched to [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) as my main distro ! I found Hyprland intuitive from the get go, especially with a dual screen setup. A pleasure to switch screens and apps just with the keyboard, and it's super fast.
I've made good progress de-Googling: switched to Duckduckgo, replaced Google Photos by a self-hosted [Immich](https://immich.app/) instance, replaced Google Drive by a daily [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) backup, Chrome by Chromium, and mostly stopped watching Youtube.

### Hobby

I recently took up Chinese Chess (Xiangqi), as it seems more popular in Vietnam than western chess. Only playing bots so far, as I fear I don't make a fun challenge to play against yet. Trying to take it seriously though, I acquired a bunch of Xiangqi books. I even started a Twitch streaming channel, [Paostorm](https://www.twitch.tv/paostorm) where I go through some theory and stream some games live.

## Focus for 2026

So, there are some areas I want to improve in 2026. Mostly, I have almost no only presence except for this blog (no idea about the readershop as I don't track metrics, but I assume 0 reader). Which makes sharing projects a bit difficult and demotivating. For Podpocket it was ok as I personnally needed the app as a way to replace Youtube, but for Prosettr or Goxy it feels a shame that I didn't manage to get more users, and I quickly lost interest.

I guess the lesson is to work on my own needs first, but still it would be nice if my work could be useful to others. So, for 2026 I want to put myself a bit more out there.

Not sure how yet, I don't find X.com or Reddit any fun, but I do enjoy streaming. I might put together a Youtube channel, or even try out Tiktok. Not sure about Discord yet.

Like most people, I could do with less doom scrolling on the phone. I have plenty of screenless play time with my kids, but I should reach for my Kindle rather than my phone in the downtimes.

Lastly, and without going too much into details, I feel like it's time to move on to a new job. I've been working at the same company for the past 6 years and it kind of stopped being fun. My Japan visa is also almost up, so I might just not renew it and call it quit. But it means I need to find another position somehow (I'm not going to live off streaming !), which means also putting myself out on Linked.in. Dreary.

On a similar note, I've recently been dialing back my use of coding agents, for a somewhat slower and more thoughtful development process. I even turned off copilot completely and wrote some functions (a throttle function in Go) entirely by hand, like it's 2022 again ! It took longer than ChatGPT obviously, but the end result my mine and did just what I wanted and nothing more, and I understood it. And I found I enjoyed the process, which means I do still like programing, luckily :)

## Merry christmas

Today, I'm starting off a 2 weeks vacation ! I want to find out if being off work will trigger my creativity, because I often daydream about working solo on my own projects, but I fall short of actual ideas. Looking forward to an interesting 2026 !
