Then I replaced the previous implementation with this one, with some added optimizations (support for secondary columns, using channels instead of an input matrix, another channel to output the solutions, etc.).\nThe best part of the algorithm is that, even though the book describes the links between nodes as “pointers,” they really are just an offset into the Node array. This makes copying the structure super easy, which in turn enables parallelizing the search process! It’s still not perfect, but here’s what I have at the moment.\nThe other advantage is that, since it’s an offset and not a pointer, I can actually choose to use int32 (instead of 64-bit pointers) and halve the memory usage again! I just defined type AppInt int32 and used that instead of int for the offsets. It works as long as you have fewer than 2 billion nodes—I have around 100 million for a 21x21 crossword, so I’m safe.\nIn a few seconds, you can generate a crossword using as many thematic words as possible.\nLastly, I’ve started using Aider (“Aider is AI pair programming in your terminal”). I’ve been feeling more and more FOMO recently with the newest LLM releases (Claude 3.7 and GPT-4.5 just this week) and the various agentic tools (Cursor’s Composer, Claude Code…). I want to give them a proper try, but I’m not ready to give up control of my workflow. I’m actually using Aider with git commit disabled (eg --no-git), as I prefer to view the diff before committing. It went well so far—I’ve been able to save quite some time (compared to copy-pasting to and from ChatGPT). For some reason, it sometimes edits the wrong part of the code though (I saw it editing the wrong CI job definition and the wrong test, but with correct code—I just had to manually move it).\nLet’s see, what else? Andrej Karpathy just released a video titled How I use LLMs, which threw me back to my earlier, pretty half-assed blog post: [How I use GitHub Copilot]({% post_url 2024-12-25-how-i-use-github-copilot %}). Curious to see how my programming process will evolve this year. I’ve been following G. Huntley’s posts about Cursor and the future of programming (see https://ghuntley.com/ngmi/ for instance) about the necessity of embracing LLM-powered programming, and anyway, it’s a pretty exciting development to follow. It has been humbling to realize a machine can do a better job than me at writing code—and frankly, it’s a good thing. Looking back to my earlier programming days, I don’t miss searching Stack Overflow or some API docs to find out what flags to pass to append to a file or such trivialities, and I get more time to focus on the big picture. OK It’s almost midnight, so I’m going to stop here and push the post before we move to March!\n",
